# Chrome Extensions

<br>

<p align="center">Learn to make your own chrome extensions using these examples. I have created these examples starting from basic "Hello World" extension to much functional ones like finding word definitions by selecting a word on the web page or changing the background color theme of a particular webpage. I'm sure by exploring these extensions you will be able to create some fun stuffs of your own and deploy them on the web store for others to use.</p>

### Manifest

Every chrome extension begin with `manifest.json` file. All these extensions listed here uses manifest version 3 `MV3`. A simple manifest file looks like this:

```
{
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "name": "Name of your extension",
    "version": "0.01",
    "description": "about your extension"
  }

```
